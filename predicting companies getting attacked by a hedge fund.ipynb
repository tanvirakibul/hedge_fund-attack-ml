    "1. Attack: Shows which companies got attacked.\n",
    "2. Size_of_Group_Composition: oup composition is usually considered in terms of how individual member characteristics will affect group cohesion or compatibility and subsequently how the group interacts.\n",
    "3. Bankruptcy probability: Bankruptcy risk refers to the likelihood that a company will be unable to meet its debt obligations. It is the probability of a firm becoming insolvent due to its inability to service its debt.\n",
    "4. Debt coefficient: The debt ratio measures the amount of leverage used by a company in terms of total debt to total assets. A debt ratio greater than 1.0 (100%) tells you that a company has more debt than assets.\n",
    "5. Solvency: Solvency is the ability of a company to meet its long-term debts and financial obligations.\n",
    "6. Invested Capital: Invested capital is the total amount of money raised by a company by issuing securities to equity shareholders and debt to bondholders, where the total debt and capital lease obligations are added to the amount of equity issued to investors.\n",
    "7. Net equity: Net equity value is defined as the difference between the fair market value of business assets and its liabilities.\n",
    "8. ROA: Return on assets (ROA) is a financial ratio that shows the percentage of profit that a company earns in relation to its overall resources (total assets).\n",
    "9. ROCE: Return on capital employed (ROCE) is a financial ratio that can be used in assessing a company's profitability and capital efficiency. In other words, the ratio can help to understand how well a company is generating profits from its capital.\n",
    "10. R&D expenses: Research and development (R&D) expenses are associated directly with the research and development of a company's goods or services and any intellectual property generated in the process."
